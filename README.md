# Hypermedea ROS Binding

Implementation of a ROS binding for [Hypermedea](https://hypermedea.github.io/).
The targeted version is ROS 1 (ROS 2 not supported).

Documentation can be found [on hypermedea.github.io](https://hypermedea.github.io/javadoc/ros-binding/latest/org/hypermedea/ros/package-summary.html).

The current implementation uses [`jrosbridge`](https://github.com/rctoris/jrosbridge) for ROS communication over WebSockets (rosbridge).
